I want to hire a venue for my birthday for 3 hours. The venue hire costs Â£200 per
hour and a refundable 10% deposit. I've written a program to check that I can afford
the cost, but something doesn't seem right.
Have a look at my program and work out what I've done wrong:
"""

my_money = input("How much money do you have? ")
hour = 3
venue_cost = 200 * hour  * 1.1

if int(my_money) >= venue_cost:
    print('You can afford the venue')
else :
    print('You cannot afford the venue')
